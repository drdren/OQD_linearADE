# OQD_linearADE
Linear advection equation solved using analog quantum computing via OQD. Please refer to oqd_1D_v2.ipynb for the tutorial. 

Additionally, the images indicate the results of the quantum solver of the linear advection equation, with comparison against the analytical solution. 


Requirements:
OQD
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
jupyter
For Windows, you will need C++.
